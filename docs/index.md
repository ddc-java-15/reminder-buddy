## Summary

This application is a tool to help people build cognition via the user creating a representative flash-card. The flash cards will use memory enhancing techniques that assist individuals in reminding themselves through deeper connections in the brain.
Cognitive memory techniques include...
* Spaced-repetition goes hand-in-hand with the tool being used in this application: flash-cards, distributed over time will not only embed knowledge, but increase capacity for the future. 
* Mnemonics and acronyms; Mnemonics is the study and development of systems for improving and assisting memory (Oxford Languages, 2020). A specific example of mnemonic design would be the solar system being referenced as the fingers on your hand. An example of an acronym would be PEMDAS, "Please excuse my dear aunt sally" used widely in the math world to recall the order-of-operations. 
* Rhymes with meaning; these have to come from your own head, not to say that you can't reference a song, but rather it has to have value to you. The closer it is to your own thoughts, the stronger the connection in the brain.

## Intended users

* Busy people who have a hard time keeping track of their life events; birthdays, anniversaries, doctors appointments.

  > As a business professional, it can be difficult to remember my personal life events that matter to me. I want my mind to be challenged by relying on clues, pictures, music, photos, and locations to recall an event instead of just being told where to go. If there is mental-space saved for things other than my work, I can achieve good work-life balance and better overall memory.

* Individuals who have issues with cognition and memory who desire to have stronger mental prowess to remembering things.

  > As an elderly person who struggles with remembering, I want something that uses proven psychological methods to provide me with opportunity to strengthen my memory to stay on top of my life's important events and appointments.


## Persistent data

* List of events
* Timing of reminders
* Intervals of reminders (how often, how many times reminded, reminders after correct answers for reinforcement)
* Data of answers of reminders (percentage correct, percentage wrong, retention rates)

## Device/external services

1. <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/CalendarContract?hl=en" title="Android calender notes">Calendar services</a>
* Establishing time/date information in reminder cards is standard practice!
* Without this service the app cannot function.

2. <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/media" title="Media information from android">Local Gallery</a>
* Add an image as a part of a reminder card, it doesn't have to give it away, but it may jog your memory!
* It's not necessary for the entire function of the app, but it helps!

3. <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/media" title="Media information from android">Local sound files</a>
* Add a song or sound bit to a reminder card to engage the mind in another way.
* Music and sound won't be necessary, but a notification may go unnoticed!

5. <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/urls/android-intents" title="Documentation for android">GPS/Google maps</a>
* Sometimes it's a location that reminds you of what you need to do, add this to access your spatial memory!
* Without a location established, it can be more difficult to recall where you are supposed to be, but the app will function without it!
