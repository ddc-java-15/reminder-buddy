## Summary

This application is a tool to help people build cognition using a normal part of phone usage. Reminders will be used to build memory by the user creating a flash-card with words, pictures, song, etc... that will assist people in reminding themselves through a connection in the brain.

## Intended users

* Busy people who have a hard time keeping track of their life events; birthdays, anniversaries, doctors appointments.

  > As a business professional, it can be difficult to remember my personal life events that matter to me. I want my mind to be challenged and keep space saved for things other than my work. So that I will have good work-life balance and better memory.

* Individuals who have issues with cognition and memory who desire to have stronger mental prowess to remembering things.

  > As an elderly person it's important to continue strengthening the mind to provide better living conditions later. This simple application is easy to use and helps build mental strength.

Write a bullet list here, including at least 2 different types of intended users. Make it reasonably specific; simply saying "Anyone who likes games" (for example) is not sufficiently specific.

For each type of intended user, include at least 1 _user story_. A user story is usually just 1 simple sentence (no more than 2 sentences), in the voice of the intended user, stating a specific task that the user performs using the app, and the benefit that will be obtained. The simplest user stories take the form 

> As a <type of intended user (_who_)> I want to <use of feature or functionality (_what_)> so that <benefit (_why_).

Please avoid writing too much for the user story. In particular, if the way the user story is written makes it difficult to see the _who_, _what_, and _why_, then you probably need to re-write it more directly. (On the other hand, a user story should not simply be a re-statement of the intended user description.)

Here is one (silly) example of an intended user, along with a user story. Please note not only the conceptual structure, but the Markdown syntax used.

* People who like to use randomness in their decision making.

    > As someone who enjoys randomness in my life, I need an app that lets me flip a virtual coin or roll one or more virtual dice, so that I can base my decisions on randomness, without having to carry coins or dice in my pockets.

## Functionality

1. Creates reminders of important events

2. Builds cognitive ability related to memory

3. Presents data that helps determine memory over time

4. Customized reminders: how many times before and how often


## Persistent data

* List of events
* Timing of reminders
* Intervals of reminders (how often, how many times reminded, reminders after correct answers for reinforcement)
* Data of answers of reminders (percentage correct, percentage wrong, retention rates)

List, in general terms and using a bullet list, what content will be stored on the Android device. This should include any information that users of your app would expect to be maintained (i.e. without connection to a server) across multiple sessions of use.
