## Functionality

Currently, reminder buddy is not ready to be implemented as a prototype. While basic function is there. It's very limited in what it can do. Functions that are confirmed to work:

1. Able to create flash cards that populate in a list on home page of application

2. Through the "Test Memory" tab, user can participate in randomized testing on self-created flash-cards.

3. Data history showing incorrect and correct answer totals.

4. Application properly connects to Google sign-in services, linking the user to their profile.

## Future Aesthetic/Cosmetic Enhancement

Visual aspects that are desired for future releases.

1. Notification windows that appear at the user-specified time.

2. Visual tip sheet for creating a memorable flash-card including examples from mnemonics 

3. Visual data representation through graphical data.

4. Customized timing for reminders are currently unavailable. The only access a user has is through the "Test Memory" tab.

5. Knowledge is power, and providing examples of and the studies behind the psychology of remembering is important to share with users. With the knowledge being quickly accessed on the device, they will have an easier time applying the techniques to their personal flash-card designs.


## Functional stretch goals and the future of Reminder Buddy

* Clear and concise integration for the device regarding notifications. In the future, the application would have a flash-card notify the user when it was time to run the test again. In addition, being able to modify each time the next interval for the card to be tested. 

* User will be able to import photos and sound bites to utilize in their flash-cards.

* In the future, Reminder Buddy will incorporate more data visuals such as pie charts, or line graphs showing memory over time gives the user visual representation of their learning. Furthermore, the addition of in-depth statistical documentation that will be available to them inside the application.
